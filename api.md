client = DemoAPIScalarGalaxy(
    bearer_auth=os.environ.get("BEARER_AUTH"),
)
```

## `Planets`

Everything about planets

### Get all planets

It's easy to say you know them all, but do you really? Retrieve all the planets and check whether you missed one.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetListParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet_list_params.py) |
| Response | [`PlanetListResponse`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet_list_response.py) |

```python
planet = client.planets.list(
    limit=10,
    offset=0,
)
```

### Create a planet

Time to play god and create a new planet. What do you think? Ah, don't think too much. What could go wrong anyway?

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetCreateParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet_create_params.py) |
| Response | [`Planet`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet.py) |

```python
planet = client.planets.create(
    name="Mars",
    type="terrestrial",
)
```

### Get a planet

You'll better learn a little bit more about the planets. It might come in handy once space travel is available for everyone.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Response | [`Planet`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet.py) |

```python
planet = client.planets.retrieve(
    planet_id=1,
)
```

### Update a planet

Sometimes you make mistakes, that's fine. No worries, you can update all planets.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetUpdateParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet_update_params.py) |
| Response | [`Planet`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet.py) |

```python
planet = client.planets.update(
    planet_id=1,
    name="Mars",
    type="terrestrial",
)
```

### Delete a planet

This endpoint was used to delete planets. Unfortunately, that caused a lot of trouble for planets with life. So, this endpoint is now deprecated and should not be used anymore.

```python
client.planets.delete(
    planet_id=1,
)
```

### Upload an image to a planet

Got a crazy good photo of a planet? Share it with the world!

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetUploadImageParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet_upload_image_params.py) |
| Response | [`PlanetUploadImageResponse`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/planet_upload_image_response.py) |

```python
planet = client.planets.upload_image(
    planet_id=1,
)
```

## `CelestialBodies`

Celestial bodies are the planets and satellites in the Scalar Galaxy.

### Create a celestial body

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`CelestialBodyCreateParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/celestial_body_create_params.py) |
| Response | [`CelestialBodyCreateResponse`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/celestial_body_create_response.py) |

```python
celestial_body = client.celestial_bodies.create(
    name="Mars",
    type="terrestrial",
)
```

## `Authentication`

Some endpoints are public, but some require authentication. We provide all the required endpoints to create an account and authorize yourself.

### Create a user

Time to create a user account, eh?

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`AuthenticationCreateUserParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/authentication_create_user_params.py) |
| Response | [`User`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/user.py) |

```python
authentication = client.authentication.create_user(
    name="Marc",
    email="marc@scalar.com",
    password="i-love-scalar",
)
```

### Get a token

Yeah, this is the boring security stuff. Just get your super secret token and move on.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`AuthenticationCreateTokenParams`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/authentication_create_token_params.py) |
| Response | [`Token`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/token.py) |

```python
authentication = client.authentication.create_token(
    email="marc@scalar.com",
    password="i-love-scalar",
)
```

### Get authenticated user

Find yourself they say. That's what you can do here.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Response | [`User`](./src/demo_api_scalar_galaxy/types/user.py) |

```python
authentication = client.authentication.list_me()
```
